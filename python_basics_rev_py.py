**Module** is like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else, is of 2 types:

**Built-in** **modules** are included in Python's standard library and do not require installation and can be used using import. Example: math, os etc.

**External modules** are not included in the standard library and need to be installed using a package manager like pip. Example: numpy, pandas etc.

**The strip()** method in Python does not limit its operation to only the exact characters at the ends of the string.
Instead, it works by removing all occurrences of any character specified in its argument from the start and end of the string.
It does not remove characters from the middle of the string.

By default, it removes whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the right side of the string
but you can also specify a set of characters to remove.
