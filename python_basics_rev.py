**Module** is like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else, is of 2 types:
**Built-in** **modules** are included in Python's standard library and do not require installation and can be used using import. Example: math, os etc.
**External modules** are not included in the standard library and need to be installed using a package manager like pip. Example: numpy, pandas etc.

"""**Typecasting**: Conversion of one data type to another.
Has 2 types:  
**Implicit Typecasting:** Here, Python automatically converts one data type to another to avoid data loss or errors during operations.

**Explicit Typecasting:** It is when you manually convert one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.
